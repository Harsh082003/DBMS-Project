📚 Overview
This project presents a Smart Waste Management System (SWMS) designed to improve urban waste collection and recycling processes through the use of a robust database management system. It addresses challenges faced by municipalities such as overflowing bins, inefficient routes, and low recycling participation by implementing data-driven solutions.

🎯 Objectives
Develop a relational database for managing waste bins, users, schedules, and recycling centers.

Enable real-time monitoring of waste levels via sensor data.

Optimize collection routes based on data insights.

Enhance user participation with interactive reporting and notifications.

🛠️ Technologies Used
